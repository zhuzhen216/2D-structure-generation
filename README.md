# 2D-structure-generation
### Based on this code, I have generated around 100 2D phosphorene structures with different symmetries.
### The paper was published in 2015 in ACS Nano 8, 12763 (2014) with the name "Tiling phosphorene".
### Initially, I generated the structures based on a lattice-gas modle; later on, we discovered that it is consistent with tiling patterns: namely, painting a 2D hexagonal lattice with two different colors.

### This work has connected symmetry, structure auto-generation, and art (I hope you also agree) together. That's why we enjoy doing science.
