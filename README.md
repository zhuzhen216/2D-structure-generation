## 2D structure generation
___
### Motivation
Phosphorene, two-dimensional black phosphorus, has draw much attention since the demostration of high-performance transistor devices in 2014. Given the fact that bulk (or 3D) phosphorus presents in a variety of structural phases, whether 2D phosphorene also has rich polymophs is an issue of interest for both fundamental knowledge about phoshphurs and practical applications, which is largely unexplored before. 
### Goal
Searching for stable 2D phosphorene structures beyond black phosphorene. 
### What is achieved by this code?
I have developed this code and enerated around 100 2D phosphorene structures with different symmetries. The structural variety of 2D phosphorene has been unveiled. The paper was published in 2015 in ACS Nano 8, 12763 (2014) with the name "Tiling phosphorene". Initially, I generated the structures based on a lattice-gas modle; later on, we discovered that it is consistent with tiling patterns: namely, painting a 2D hexagonal lattice with two different colors.

This work has connected symmetry, structure auto-generation, and art (I hope you also agree) together. That's why we enjoy doing science.
